    <p class="lead">A video call featuring them all. A medley of personality ready to test your sanity.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead">Featuring (in order of appearance): <br> Animated Ananya <br> Anti Alli <br> Promiscuous Prachi <br> Inquisitive Ishita <br> Absurd Arnav <br> Sophisticated Srishti <br> Gauri Gauri <br> Yogi Yash  <br> Traditional Tuktuk <br> Author Amay </p>
    <p class="lead"> Sorry to Meghnad, Samia and all the other folk who didn't make it to the call. I don't remember the others, and as for M and S - I had too many characters already. 
    <p> Disclaimer: The only overlap with Mirambikan alumni and the aforementioned characters are their names and some major life details. Everything else is purely fictional and doesn't intend to insinuate anything about the real people that share names with these characters.</p>

    <p>

        Ananya: "Oh my god, guys! It's been FOREVER. I thought for a hot second some of you had DIED.  HOW'S EVERYONE BEEN?!?"
        <br><br>
        
        Alli: "I mean, it hasn't been that long. To be honest, this is almost too frequent for a school reunion for my energy levels."
        <br><br>
        
        Prachi: "Mm, I like the idea of a hot second hanging around at home."
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "How have you guys been? How's Suchitra, Yash? Isn't the Canadian summer the greatest Arnav, eh? How've you been, Sooraj? What have you been up to? I heard about the Master's degree Srishti! Very cool. What is "Food Studies?" What about you, Ga... "
        <br><br>
        Ishita gets cut off by Arnav
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "Eh, I don't think that's how you're supposed to use eh. But yeah, this is exciting, Srishti. I've heard New York City is called The Big Apple because of its world-renowned culinary heritage. Have you thought of monetizing India's deep-rooted cultural legacy by developing an indigenous beverage chain named Srish-Tea in N.Y.C.?"  
        <br><br>
        Alli: "Oh, Food Studies! I was interested in it too. But I was put off by the prerequisites needed in business courses like financial planning."
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "Woah, which college would require you to take business courses for an M.A. degree?"
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "I'm glad you used the article 'an' for M.A., Srishti."
        <br><br>
        Yash: "Srishti, Alli's talking about how the prerequisites are to better prepare students from the unstoppable marching of time that is slowly guiding them towards an inevitable debt. Thanks for teaching that to me, Bella."
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "What?"
        <br><br>
        Amay: "That's rather poetic and spiritual, Yash".
        <br><br>
        Alli: "Who are you again? Oh. That guy. Ga.."
        <br><br>
        Gauri quickly cuts Alli off.
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "You're welcome. I didn't remember it being you who pointed at me that day in French class. Also, isn't that kinda inappropriate considering you're dating Suchitra?"
        <br><br>
        Tuktuk: "Dating? She's met his parents. It's only a matter of time before they do their seven revolutions." 
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "I think it was me. Yash, why are you so strange? It's intimidating. I wonder what Suchitra says in return to match your absurdity."
        <br><br>
        Prachi: "Suchitra make of me like one of your French girls."
        <br><br>
        Tuktuk frowns. Shivanshi, Alli and Gauri sigh. Ishita looks puzzled. Yash blushes. Sooraj and Prachi smile. Arnav drools. 
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "Okay, yeah, that was way better than what I had in mind. Good job."
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "Wait, so you're really going to get married? That's great! Tell me everything about Suchitra! The last I heard was that she was studying Arts in D.U.?"
        <br><br>
        Ananya: "MARRIAGE! OH MY GOD. I KNEW It had been forever since we talked! What's next? Gauri GRADUATING? I feel so out of the loop; this sucks SO MUCH. But at the same time, I'm SO HAPPY you're getting MARRIED, Yash! Why didn't you invite me to the wedding?!?"
        <br><br>
        Yash: "Dust thou art, to dust thou returnest was not spoken of the sole. To rise cleanly below, one must learn to sink above. Fare thee well, but is it truly adieu if I will return with haste <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=bhidu&oq=bhidu&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l8j46i512.2296j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"> bhidu? </a>"
        <br><br>
        Everyone except Sooraj: "<a href = "Oshawott.jpeg">Uhh..." </a>
        <br><br>
        Sooraj: "He means that it's impossible not to get your body dirty/dusty, but he can at least prevent that for his feet by washing them in the sink, and he'll be brb. Also, yeah, he just rhymed adieu with bhidu."
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "Alright, now that Yash's gone. Can anyone explain what he was on about earlier?"
        <br><br>
        Sooraj: "You'll be poor Srishti. That's what Alli allieuded to."
        <br><br>
        Alli: "You can do better than that, Sooraj."
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "Hmm. Alright, I walked into that one. But to be honest, I think it's primitive and classless to seek purely pragmatic gain from our education. I underwent a rather transformational experience when I critically studied the Dead Poets Society for my filmography elective. I think John Keating put it rather succinctly, "The human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for." Don't you guys think? 
        <br><br>
        Shivanshi: "Good sentences, and well pronounced Srishti."
        <br><br>
        Amay: "Oh god. I just realized that Srish-Tea is her Instagram ID, and it's not a novel idea at all."
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "Classic you."
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "But, damn. I wanted to go to America. New York City especially! All the tech comes there first. Mobile phones, the internet, credit cards. Cordless, wireless,  cashless. You'll be at the forefront of all of these!
        <br><br>
        Alli: "Yep! Cash less is fairly accurate. But you also forgot, jobless and homeless."
        <br><br>
        Shivanshi: "Guys can you give her a break, please?"
        <br><br>
        Prachi: "How're the boys like there, Srishti? How defining is their big adam's apple?"
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "I haven't met too many, to be honest."
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "It's a girl's college?"
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "No, Gauri. Thankfully I don't think that exists as a concept here for higher education. It's just that even though I've seen many people around me, I don't know how they identify as, and so I assume the default to be gender-neutral."
        <br><br>
        Sooraj: "Right, I guess she meant cis-gendered males."
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "Yeah, I'm curious about that too!"
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "I mean. I think mere looks are just a social construct. We are what we eat. We are what we look like from the surface. All of these are dated ideologies that I think people need to weed out from their subconscious to truly appreciate the finer beauties of their inner selves".
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "Why do you care, Ishita? I've visited you in Toronto. I know who you're hiding."
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "Not this again. Please."
        <br><br>
        Prachi's ears perk up. Amay smiles. 
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "Oh, you mean Divij."
        <br><br>
        Prachi: "I saw your photos on Instagram, and oh my. I thought you could never do better than Sheil, but boy, this comes close. REALLY close"
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "Uh.. Sheil and I never dated?"
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "Yeah, Prachi. Can you calm the fungus down and stop acting like a feminine canine?"
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "That doesn't rhyme."
        <br><br>
        Prachi: "I don't mind being one if it meant Divij would be smashing dis bitchh, GOTTEM" 
        <br><br>
        Prachi gets lost in fantasy.
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "That.. doesn't rhyme either. Also, considering how much Prachi's spoken here today compared to Shivanshi, it tells us a lot about the kind of person you are, Amay."
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "But anyway, I'm sure all of you are curious, so I'll spill the Srish-Tea. I met Divij at this place near Toronto. He was modelling at the Scientifically-verified Hunk Exhibition In London. 
        <br><br>
        Sooraj: "You mean he was a model at S.H.E.I.L.? That's a rather alarming coincidence."
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "No it isn't. That's where I met Sheil too. They named it after him."
        <br><br>
        Ananya: "What the feetus! You travelled to the U.K. and I never knew? Gosh. That's. Ugh. Also, Prachi, can you send his shirtless photos to the Girls' group? Thanks."
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "That's.. yeah. I'll let Srishti say it. And no, London is actually a place in Ontario quite close to Canada. Did you guys know that Canada's capital is Ottawa, Ontario? But the capital of Ontario itself is Toronto. And the capital of the United Kingdom is London. Also, Amay, don't even think about asking to be added to the girls' group."
        <br><br>
        Amay sighs.
        <br><br>
        Srishti: "That's inappropriate, Ananya. Darn, Gauri, I didn't know about this rather interesting tidbit. Thanks."
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "Is it just me or Alli the sour punk and these nerds are honestly making me crave some candy right now."
        <br><br>
        Shivanshi: "Srishti, sometimes I feel like our personalities are too similar, and because you're more boisterous you steal my lines."
        <br><br>
        Ananya: "Yeah, maybe you shouldn't EXIST Shana!"
        <br><br>
        Amay: "True."
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "Anyways. So yeah, I live with him now, and it's great! I really enjoy his company. I think he's compassionate, empathetic and.."
        <br><br>
        Prachi: "Hot."
        <br><br>
        Gauri sighs. Amay and Sooraj smile. Arnav drools.
        <br><br>
        Ishita: "True, he does satisfy several societal norms of what is considered attractive, but he's much more than that to me."
        <br><br>
        Shivanshi: "That's honestly so heart-warming. I'm so glad you met someone you connected with, Ishita."
        <br><br>
        Alli: "I mean, I see several issues with a live-in relationship so quick. But I just thank your stars that you're not Gauri and Amay."
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "Oh.. no."
        <br><br>
        Ananya: "What. Did. You. Just. Say? OH MY GOD. NO. CLUCKING. WEIGH. I meant WAY I was startled, okeigh!? Are you guys getting married too?! You're okay with ADOPTING Amay? Oh, god. I mean ADOPTING, AMAY. I hate commas! Speaking of which... this is so overwhelming I feel like I'm going into a coma.
        <br><br>
        Arnav: "Gaumay, Amuri, Auri, they all fall flat to the laconic... Gay"
        <br><br>
        Prachi: "Ooh.. your kids will be smart and beautiful. Too bad cordless, wireless and cashless technologies aren't advanced enough to have contactless sex."
        <br><br>
        Yash: "Returnest I, for I have promises to keep, Two roads diverged in a yellow wood. I'm sorry but wasn't Belle both?"
        <br><br>
        Everyone except Sooraj: "<a href = "Oshawott.jpeg">Uhh..." </a>
        <br><br>
        Sooraj: "He says he's back, and wasn't Gauri both smart and beautiful?"
        <br><br>
        Prachi: "I never implied the contrary. Don't contort my words; that's reserved for my body. Gauri, you have a lot of explaining to do. First to these ordinary friends, and then a lot more to me, your best friend."
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "Hmm. That's Alli ttle misleading. We're just really close friends. 
        <br><br>
        Tuktuk: "Yeah, right. A guy and a gal that speak almost daily for over a year? I'm sorry, but if that's not dating, then I don't know what is."
        <br><br>
        Alli: "They wish each other Happy New Day. Every day."
        <br><br>
        Tuktuk: "Get an ashram, you two."
        <br><br>
        Gauri: "I'll explain. It all started last year during the first reunion call."
        <br><br>
        to be continued...
