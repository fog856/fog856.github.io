  <h> Thank you so much for all the company, the care, the chemistry, the entertainment with all our "nerdy" interests. You make me feel valued along with making me feel like all my idiosyncracies are perhaps not just incomprehensible ramblings of an absurdist but instead engaging, entertaining and witty expressions of thought. You inspire me to keep being myself comfortably without doubting my personality; I guess that's why I'm coming to realise the me I am with you is the one I enjoy being the most.
    <br><br>
    So, yep. A website. That's the idea! What excited me about this website is that it acted as a seed for infinite possibilities for today and the future. 
          It can converge and take shape, twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break and then reform again. 
    It's a seed that I'm sowing, which I hope will only grow bigger with time to host new activities and other creative expeditions.
    <br><br>
    For today however, I've written three pieces that intend to evoke different kinds of emotion within you. I hope there's enough variety and you enjoy them!
    They're meant to be read in order. 
    I also present to you a rather challenging (I hope) cryptic crossword puzzle. I've tried to mix in mostly challenging clues with some easier ones. I hope the difficulty is appropriate and you enjoy yourself.
    <br>
    These were run-off-the-mill standard ideas that I had to do simply because I thoroughly enjoy them, but for the season finale, I have a rather interesting, unique creation that I sincerely hope you will cherish and use along with me (and no, that isn't supposed to be interpreted as you using the creation along with using me)
    <br>Everything on this website is hand-crafted using code and text on an interface that isn't visible to you. It's an area of tech I hadn't really ventured too much into and I enjoyed learning about various programming languages and constructs needed to create websites from the ground up.
    That's why nothing you see on this website is static and I'll constantly be editing things according to context and occasion! You could regard this as the first message on this wall.

    I hope you have a really nice day and I get to talk to you soon!
