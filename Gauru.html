    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>

Is it weird? Is it strange? Unnatural?  I don't know. I've never really thought about it. <br><br>

I'd sit down with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon on the comfortable recliner in the dining room, occasionally with a book in hand but more often just relishing the acidity of the wine, the hit of the alcohol and the slight kick from the bell pepper. <br><br>

In between sips, I'd get plenty of time to think about so many people and so many things. <br><br>

I'd introspect. What was I passionate about? What are things I liked? Who are the people I fancied? <br><br>

I've always wondered about the last question. What is my type? <br>
I knew I was a little different from the norm that way. Unlike most women, I wasn't too fond of brute, tall macho-men with bodies akin to a sculpture on which you could grind meat. I didn't swoon at the idea of a braveheart who'd protect me from wild animals on our honeymoon camping in the forestry of Munnar with no weaponry except his limbs and teeth.<br>
Nor was I deeply attracted to the suave, charming, extroverted spotlight of the party with his well-timed jokes and familiarity with modern colloquialisms and trends to ensure his sociability.
<br><br>

So what could win me over then?
<br>
I didn't know for sure, but I had a few ideas. 
<br><br>
I was aware fairly early on in my life that I, to put it quite frankly, was more mature than the kids around me. 
<br>
As Alli and Tuktuk built sand-castles in the sand-pit and Shana carefully composed her magnum-opus tirelessly jotting down the phrase happy trees, I would grab a fistful of sand in my little hand and watch as the grains would slip through my fingers. "Silicon dioxide," I'd whisper to myself. The ephemeral nature of the sand in my hand would remind me of the arcade game that I finished on November 8th. Wasn't the sand just an analogy of the game and the game an analogy for precious things in life?  I tried so hard to hold on to the sand with these digits of mine, but the harder I clenched my fist, the faster it would slip through the gaps.
<br><br>
As Yash and Arnav competed with each other on who would down the aloo and drink the lemonade the quickest, I'd hold the lemonade glass in my hand just like I would my Bordeaux glass of sangria and take a sip. "How rejuvenating after a tiring morning watching the boys play football," I'd think to myself. Lemonade? How did the word come about? What was its etymology? Thanks to my fluency in Fran√ßaise, I swiftly concluded that it could only come from a charade of "Le Men Aide," i.e., an aide to mankind.
<br><br>
As my neanderthal-esque classmates ravaged their meals classlessly, I'd play out a passionate, poignant, and riveting speech in my mind on notions of patriarchy and how even something as gender-neutral as lemonade had men as the representative term for all of the Homosapien species.

<br><br>
I remember being disturbed on my birthday in Red group. I was turning one year older.  I remember hugging Amma and slowly walking to the center of the circle to cut my cake. At age four, I was finally sentient enough to realise what this birthday truly meant. Like a divine epiphany, it flashed into my sized brain that one's birthday was only a reminder to themself about the unstoppable marching of time that is slowly guiding us all towards an inevitable death. As my simple-minded classmates cheered and sang, "Happy birthday" in their innocent oblivion, the weight of this realization was wearing me down. My father asked all of us to smile, and I knew that at this rate, I'd look like a Debbie downer in this birthday photo, so I prayed to God for an answer; for clarity.
<br><br>
My father counted down from three and once again with a flash, I realised that maybe my view was incomplete. Perhaps, death was necessary. Essential. For otherwise, why would one value life? If I was immortal, then would I strive to do anything? Would I ever explore, go out of my comfort zone and seize opportunities with both hands if I knew that I most definitely could do it at some other time, in some other place?
<br><br>
Just like that, I found contentment. This understanding of the universe led to the purest form of glee. I looked up at the camera and <a href = "gauru.jpeg">grinned</a> the broadest I had that entire week. Achan took the photo.
<br><br>
So yeah, if it wasn't clear to you yet, I was pretty dang mature. Hence, it was only natural that I was attracted to mentally older, wiser, prudent and learned men. As someone who is fascinated with all kinds of factoids and trivia, I liked my man to be someone who would geek out and quiz me with questions from textbooks. A man who would look at me in awe and wonder when I'd correctly recall the vaguest bullet point from page 38 and precisely answer his question. 
<br><br>
I'd want a man who thrived in learning, someone who had several volumes of text at the back of his mind. A man who wouldn't regard his greater knowledge in a specific field as a reason to be pompous and superior over other, less academic folk. Instead, I'd want my man to be someone who'd find passion and pleasure in sharing what he knew to an ear that was eager to listen.
<br><br>
I'd want a cultured man who was in a profession that I deemed noble. Something that I'd be proud of doing myself. I'd understand if he pursued a career only for financial and monetary success; however, I would much rather a man who'd follow a profession because he wanted to give back to society and the country; because he wanted to help people.
<br><br>
I closed my eyes, and I could see so clearly the men I wanted. Princi, Anuj bhaiya, Sankalp bhaiya, Jasbir bhaiya, my violin teacher, Prof Subash, and the reel went on.
<br><br>
Was it weird? Was it strange? Unnatural? Why? Were my parameters of attraction so unreasonable? If they weren't, then was it my fault that the only people I met that satisfied them were my teachers? Was it wrong that raising my hand and answering his question pitch-perfectly; watching his eyes meet mine in a class of 150 and gently smile at my precision gave me inexplicable pleasure and validation? Was I to blame if I slaved away burning the midnight oil to prepare for my exam because I knew that I wanted to get at least nineteen percent above passing; because I derived great joy at the idea of my professor looking through the mark-sheet and seeing my name corresponding to a score that passed with flying colors.
<br>
Was I supposed to feel guilty if I felt bummed out when I realised I was forced to call every MBK teacher with the brotherly-moniker of bhaiya?
<br><br>
If that's what the world thinks, then maybe, just maybe, it wasn't me who was wrong. It was the <a href = "amloo.jpg">world</a>.
