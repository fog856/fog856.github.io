    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>
        I got on my cycle and slowly started pedalling back to Azad hall. Have you ever done things deliberately slow?
Just stopped and immersed yourself in the moment?
<br><br>
My mind's constantly fluttering to the past and the future, making it hard to do that. However, for some reason, the cycle ride from the Encore selection to Azad was surprisingly mentally serene. 
<br><br>
In those moments of clarity, my neurons dim, and my senses heighten. I hear the little sounds—the flutter of the birds, the honks from the road, the buzzing of insects. The chatter of folk on their evening escapades mixed in with the suspiciously genteel articulation of my rude bully of a wingmate when he's sitting with his girlfriend on the bench. 
<br><br>
I'd see a professor hold his child's hand while they ate cotton candy from the Tech Market. I'd watch the protestors with their billboards sitting outside the Director's house. I'd see another bench watching the warm, shy and soft-spoken wingmate angrily argue with his hands flailing and eyebrows frowning when he's sitting with his girlfriend on the bench—the duality of man.
<br><br>
And the smells, yeah. As you can (maybe) imagine, the campus mostly smelled like shit. Literally. I don't know what was wrong. The workers cleaned and swept relatively regularly, but maybe it was just all the dirty dogs roaming about carrying their stench like skunks from The Looney Tunes. Or, perhaps, it was all the students that bathed once a fortnight. Probably both.
<br><br>
But, meh. That's the thing with heightened senses; when your mind is empty, you can't preferentially switch one of them off. Legend has it baers were once a popular sighting on campus, only to either move to Tirupati or turn extinct because of their extraordinary sense of smell that led to their demise.
<br><br>
Neglecting the aroma, however - these little windows of neural inactivity were rather blissful. Focusing sharply on all these little events around me and trying my best to absorb them made me feel like I was a child again. Free from worry and anxiety. 
<br><br>
I like to believe that being immersed in the world around us instead of our own thoughts is instinctively therapeutic because why else would we be placed in this world in the first place. 
<br><br>
But good things don't last forever, and slowly and steadily, I began to loop back to first year. It was always the same routine of thoughts. The same walk down memory lane. Let me jot down some context.<br><br> I'd worked hard during the JEE. I managed to do well for myself with a mixture of luck and skill and made it to the reputed IIT Kharagpur. Was I the best in my class? No. But I was pretty close. All my peers and teachers respected me for my sharpness and discipline. I'd get inexplicable joy at the thought of achieving nineteen per cent over the average, corresponding to a score that passed with flying colours in my mocks. More than the adulation I gained from the family, friends and teachers - I respected myself. I was proud of what I was doing. I'd work extra hours to accommodate for my lack of genetic ability compared to the top performers. I was at peace with who I was and where I was heading. 
<br><br>
But then JEE ended. Looking back, this was supposed to be the beginning of my journey, which, to be honest, wasn't completely inaccurate since it was the beginning of something. Something that resembled more the end.
<br><br>
The girl I liked went to study medicine, and I went to Bengal to study Maths. Did it hurt that we would distance? Yeah, it did. But I think I'd have been able to deal with it pretty well if the other issues hadn't cropped up.
<br><br>
What other issues? Well, for starters -  What next? What did I want to achieve now, and why? I didn't know. I just wanted to spend time with her for now, before I left college, but I guess I'd sacrificed the time I had in her proximity to do well at this exam.
<br><br>
That's fine; It's the choice I made. It was hard to come to terms with it, but I managed. I left for Kharagpur and began my first semester. I tried to look for goals that'd keep me motivated. I started by trying to pay as much attention as I could during classes. For some reason, the amount of information I absorbed and processed with my rapt attention seemed much lesser than most of my peers putting in half-hearted efforts.  
<br><br>
I wasn't sure if that was fine; I was never the sharpest, but I was always decent at what I did. Intellectual prowess is something that significantly defined my self-esteem, and to see its integrity being questioned was like a massive lump in my throat. 
<br><br>
Maybe it was a divine message for me to explore my interests. Find what I was great at. Satisfaction to me then came from being able and respected, so maybe it was a signal for me to find my true calling. 
<br><br>
But I was rejected in virtually all the society interviews I was interested in, and I refused to apply to the ones that my friends mocked for their lack of <i>coolness</i>.
<br><br>
That's when this castle of doubt slowly began constructing itself. Like a burden on my back gradually growing heavier, leeching my ability, I began to carry out my days almost with a handicap.
<br><br>
I was happy that she was doing great. We'd talk much lesser, maybe only thirty minutes a day, because medicine was hard. Sometimes, when the conversation was great, and I felt strongly drawn towards her, I'd cut it short and quickly say bye for the night. In the beginning, I couldn't figure out why I was doing it, but I slowly began to understand that It was a reflex action of fear. I was already beginning to lose control of my life, and I didn't want to feel the pain and anxiety thinking about when she'd have to go to study. So as a means of establishing control over when I'd want to feel what, I'd tell her I had to leave and I was sorry.
<br><br>
Ignoring those few nights a fortnight, our ship was still afloat. She was working hard along with being very motivated to learn as much as possible and be an excellent medical professional. Seeing her inspired me to work hard myself and bridge the gap I had intellectually with KGPians around me.
<br><br>
As the weeks passed by, I was slowly losing grip over my attendance. I couldn't understand too much, and it was harder to get up in the morning and leave for class when both my roommates had long since stopped attending—August mostly comprised of me sleeping excessively during the day, trying my best to be productive but failing. I'd look forward to the half an hour at night when I could talk to her; the first five minutes at 12 would always be hard. She'd tell me how hard her day was and how much she'd worked. I'd feel like if she knew how I'd whiled away my entire day trying hard to study things I wasn't interested in anymore, she wouldn't see me the same way as she had all these years. On some days, I'd completely evade the "How was your day?" question. On the other, I'd lie and tell her sheepishly how satisfied I felt with the strides I made that day. 
<br><br>
With time, as I began to feel how worthless I was at fulfilling my responsibility as a student at a coveted institution, it became harder to talk to her. Our conversations became more awkward, and I began to lose the charisma and confidence I once had when we first met.
<br><br>
Even the half an hour we shared was often cut short by me or her due to our dwindling chemistry and growing distance. The fifteen hundred kilometres between us didn't help in our occasional attempts to reconnect to the other.
<br><br>
Her birthday and our first exams at University were going to be in the middle of September. I knew that this was the chance I had to both seize my self-esteem as well as make her something grand to show her how much I cared and rekindle the warmth we once shared.
<br><br>
I studied hard with my roommates throughout September. Even after they'd sleep and I'd finish talking to her, I'd stay up a bit longer to cover more material. Since we were both preparing for our exams, our exchanges were reduced to just a few messages at midnight. But I knew that this temporary distance would mean nothing once I'd made her grand gift after our exams. 
<br><br>
Her exams ended a day before mine did. She tried texting me before my last paper, but I was too busy to talk that night. My exams ended the next day, and my roommates made a plan to go out for the evening. We roamed the campus the entire night, although I didn't have a lot of fun. It'd be rather uncool to text while we were out, so I couldn't talk to her that night either. Honestly, I'm not sure if it mattered anyway since in my mind we'd only revive after her birthday, which was coming in three days.
<br><br>
I woke up the following day, ready to begin my creative journey and make her gift. I didn't know what I wanted to do yet, so I lay on my bed and thought.
<br><br>
I ended up watching a lot of YouTube along with browsing Instagram. I took an afternoon nap, and before I knew it, it was nearing midnight.
<br><br>
She wished me as she usually does. We were both free, finally. We hadn't talked properly in forever. But I was so upset that I didn't feel any guilt at all about today that I couldn't face her. I asked her if we could talk after her birthday since I had some work for the next few days. I just needed this time to fix everything finally between us.
<br><br>
She reacted strangely. I guess it made sense. We were both free after what seemed like forever, and <i>I didn't talk to her because instead I wanted to make something for her.</i> I guess anyone would be taken aback by my request then. But as usual, she always accommodated, and we agreed to talk after her birthday.
<br><br>
I felt an empty void that night. Why didn't I work on the gift? I did want to make her happy. I wanted us to be who we once were. We used to feel so connected. So warm. I wanted that back. So why didn't I? Why couldn't I even do the things I wanted to do? Why did I not feel bad anymore when I didn't?
<br><br>
But, I had tomorrow. So it was alright. I woke up early the next morning. I'd planned to bunk all my day classes that day. "Happy eighteenth birthday, ". I wrote carefully. I began to write her name. Somehow, I misspelt it. How could I misspell her name? It frustrated me. I got up and paced around the room. I couldn't come up with any ideas. I googled a bit to try to find further inspiration and got lost in a rabbit hole. My roommates returned from lunch and looked at my sheet of paper with her incorrect spelling written on it. "That's all you managed?". I didn't have a retort because it was true. That's all I had managed. Annoyed, I decided to leave the room.
<br><br>
I took my paper and cycled to the library. I sat down in Hall 5 and saw a couple making out at the corner seat of the last row. Usually, I wasn't the kind to be perturbed but today felt different. I got up and sat in Hall 4 instead. 
<br><br>
I put my head down and started scribbling various ideas. The scribbling turned to doodling and the doodling to drooling as I fell asleep.
<br><br>
I woke up a few hours later, and it was dark outside. In my sleep, I'd mistakenly made a few pen marks on the original sheet, along with some of my drool falling on it. 
<br><br>
The library was going to close any time. I got up and decided to head back home. So far, all I had with me was a stained piece of paper with a scribble, and her name spelt incorrectly.
<br><br>
I decided to resume after I talked to her that night.
The clock turned twelve, and as usual, I saw her online at 11:59:50. The clock struck twelve, but she didn't message. Why? I couldn't figure it out for a moment.
<br><br>
I then remembered that I'd asked her to talk to me after her birthday. For some reason, this realisation incredibly annoyed me. I decided to call it a night early and wake up early the next day because I didn't feel like I could be productive anymore. I wonder why she came online at that time then, if not to wish me.
<br><br>
Once again, at the end of the day I found it odd how I wasn't wracked with any guilt. But I was glad because maybe then I could work the next day without feeling too upset about my lack of progress in the last two days.
<br><br>
My alarm rang the following morning and I switched it off intending to wake up in a few minutes. The next thing I remember was being woken up at eleven to my roommates screaming in excitement and glee.
<br><br>
In thinking about her birthday, I completely forgot our exam results were due to release that day.  
<br><br>
My roommates had gotten all As or EXes. Since I'd studied with them, I felt the burden on my back lighten knowing I'd probably done well. I felt relieved I could finally focus on the gift.
<br><br>
I opened the website, and I'd got a C or a D in all my courses. I didn't feel anything too powerful when I saw the letters except the growing burden on my back.
<br><br>
It was late in the morning, and I knew I had to get my act together. One of my roommates forced me to go out for lunch with them to celebrate his success. They didn't ask me about my grades. I guess they'd checked themself. He promised me he'd help with the gift after we were back. I figured I'd take up the offer.
<br><br>
We got back late afternoon, and he immediately started coming up with ideas. I told him how I'd had a hard time coming up with anything really, and he reassured me not to fret. He asked me a few questions about her and simultaneously drew skeletons for various potential ideas I could take up. I watched in awe as he came out with so much so quick.
<br><br>
Since he'd scheduled a date with his girlfriend, he left me with a very well-formed set of ideas along with their basic outlines that I could work on in the next two hours to finish the final gift. I told him how grateful I was.
<br><br>
I still felt mostly numb. Once he left, I looked at everything and marvelled at how much he could do compared to how little I'd managed in close to three days. I realised that day that we were simply made different. Today's exam results and this was evidence that I was, quite simply, inferior. In that moment, I finally felt the numbness being replaced by sadness. Grief. Annoyance. Tears flowed gently down my eyes. I locked my door and curled up on my bed and cried for what seemed like forever.
<br><br>
I'd lost self-belief. I felt like I couldn't do anything. I knew I couldn't do anything. I listened to Mad World on loop. 11:20. 11:40. 11:55. Tears streamed down my face lamenting my incompetence. I opened WhatsApp at 11:59. As I waited, I looked at all the detailed schematics and drawings he'd made for me to finish. In the corner was my paper with her misspelt name, the scribble and the drool. 11:59:50 I saw her come online, but I didn't have the strength. I quit the app and laid my phone by my side. 
<br><br>
My phone lit up. "Happy.. new.. day?" she said on her birthday at 12:00. 
I wiped my tears, opened her chat window and looked for the three dots. I pressed the Block button and confirmed "Yes".
<br><br>
She never called me after that, and I have never heard from her since. <br>I miss her so much.
